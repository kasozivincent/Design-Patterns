Design Patterns
===============

Design Patterns have been around in our industry even before the 1990s. In 1994,
a group of four smart engineers decided to document the then recurring patterns
that they continously faced daily in their designs in their seminal book, 
**Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software**.

Since the title of the book was so long to pronounce, developers gave it the funny
name of Gang of Four (GoF) since it was written by four authors.
