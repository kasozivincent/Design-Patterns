Case Study
==========

We are going to write a simple program that reads trade records 
from a file, parses them, validates them and then stores them in 
a database.

Project Workflow
----------------

#. Read file
In this part, we read the trade reads from the file in which they are stored.

#. Parsing
We check to see if the trade records are stored in a valid structure.

#. Validation
Here we check to see if the corresponding parts of the trade records are valid.

#. Mapping
Here we map the validated trade records into domain objects.

#. Storage
In this final step we store this formed domain objects into a database.
